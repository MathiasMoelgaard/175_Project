This version is for *Submission*

We put up a test with according data. Use `python3 main.py`

modules and environments needed:

Keras\
keras-tcn\
pandas\
numpy\
statsmodels\
tensorflow >= 1.15\
sklearn\
matplotlib\
and maybe other environement

(optional) if you want to train your own model:

To train a new model, set loadModel to None and specify the model type w/ model = 1 or model = 2\
`model = 1` is the frist architecture\
`model = 2` for the second architecture\
specify the number of moments that the model is to use as well as that is required for the model to be made\
